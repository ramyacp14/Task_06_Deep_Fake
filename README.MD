# AI Video Interview – Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse 2025

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to convert verified sports analytics into a broadcast-style AI video interview. Using **HeyGen**, we produced a stadium stand-up segment where an AI reporter presents key insights from Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse’s 2025 season. The video is grounded in verified statistics and avoids any invented data.

## 🛠 Tools Used

* **HeyGen:** Script → AI avatar video with stadium background, subtitles, and light music.
* **NotebookLM:** Cross-checked phrasing and ensured data accuracy from source statistics.
* *(Optional for future)* Colossyan or Lumen5 for multi-presenter or b-roll data visualization.

## 🎬 Workflow

1. **Script Development:**

   * Write concise, stadium-style stand-up script (1–2 sentences per key point) using verified statistics.
2. **Verify Data:**

   * Cross-reference Task 05 notebook outputs and source CSV to ensure accuracy.
3. **HeyGen Video Production:**

   * Paste script → select presenter, 16:9 stadium background → subtitles on → light background music.
   * Review pacing, numeric overlays, and lip-sync alignment.
4. **Export & Share:**

   * Export MP4 → add public share link → archive script + data + video for reproducibility.

## 📄 Script (AI Reporter, \~60s)

> *Live from Syracuse, we’ve broken down the Orange women’s lacrosse season through the numbers.*
>
> Across 19 games, the team scored 347 total points — that’s 235 goals and 112 assists.
>
> Up front, Emma Muchnick set the pace with 34 goals, while Angela Beardsley was the playmaker, leading with 46 assists.
>
> On the defensive end, Coco Vandiver stood out with 40 caused turnovers, shutting down opponents at key moments.
>
> Efficiency tells its own story. Olivia Adamson posted the best shooting percentage at 55.6% on more than 20 shots. And when games were on the line, Caroline Trinkaus delivered — scoring 4 game-winners.
>
> One of the most complete players? Joely Caramelli, balancing 20 points on offense with 23 ground balls and 11 caused turnovers.
>
> Strategically, Syracuse shines with versatile midfielders but still shows a defensive gap — opponents scored 337 points compared to the Orange’s 347.
>
> The takeaway? Finishers, creators, and two-way players drove Syracuse’s success, but shoring up defense could define their next season.
